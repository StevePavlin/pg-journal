# üêò pg-journal

**pg-journal** is a framework agnostic Event Store for PostgreSQL inspired by the works of Akka and multiple experimental event store attempts in [Immutable Stack](https://github.com/StevePavlin/immutable-stack).

## Library/Documentation Goals

- ‚úÖ Global position streaming/checkpointing for read models
- ‚úÖ Gap detection for projections
- ‚úÖ Opinionated projections/checkpointing
- ‚úÖ Opinionated write retry policy
- ‚úÖ Real life example apps
- ‚úÖ Competing consumers pattern for external consumer with implementations for AWS Kinesis/Redis
- ‚úÖ Support for table partitioning for faster btree rebuilds
- ‚úÖ Archiving to AWS S3 of old partitions
- ‚úÖ Seamless replication between clusters for blue-green deployments
- ‚úÖ Automated performance testing at scale on bigger EC2/RDS instances at scale (1B+ rows)
- ‚úÖ Guides on how to deal with every type of schema change that will happen in production and how it relates to standard state-based persistence
- ‚úÖ Flexibility of synchronous projections (same ACID transaction) or asynchronous
- ‚úÖ 100% test coverage

Steps to run the test suite:

- Create a local cluster (optional) - `docker-compose up`
- Enter the following line in .env with the cluster credentials you're testing against:
```
DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:6337/pg_journal_test
```
- Drop, create and run schema DDL - `yarn db:setup`
- Run tests - `yarn test`
